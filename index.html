          <h2>Los Angeles County killed 905 people between the years 2000 and 2020. 862 people were between the average working ages of 16 to 64. Combined, the years of income-potential lost to Black, Latinx, Asian and white
            communites amounts to $1,368,019,545. </h2>

          <h3> Black and Latinx communites lost $1 trillion in income-potential between them, alone; combined they make up the bulk of total income loss, depite earning less per capita than their white and Asian counterparts. </h3>



          <p> As the national conversation about police brutality turns to defunding the police, Los Angeles County serves as a prime example of the economic impact police have on local communites. LAPD, alone, is set to take $3 billion of the city's
            general fund-- more than half of the city's unrestricted revenue for 2020-2021. LAPD, the largest police dept. in Los Angeles County, also kills citizens at nearly double the rate of almost any other police dept., nationwide. A look at
            the total years
            of life lost within these communites further highlights the financial indignities LA's law enforcement units put upon the public.</p>

          <p> Since men make up 96% of those killed by LA County police officers, and men make 20 to
            50 cents more than women on the dollar, the financial damage done to communiites of color, as indicated in the graph below, is a conservsative estimate.</p>
