          <h2>Between the years 2000 and 2020 police in Los Angeles County killed 905 people. 862 people were between the average working ages of 16 to 64. Combined, the years of income-potential lost to Black, Latinx, white an Asian
            communites amounts to $1,368,019,545. </h2>

          <h3> Black and Latinx communites saw the greatest damage, with $1 Trillion in income-potential lost between them, alone. </h3>



          <p> As the national conversation about police brutality turns to defunding the police, Los Angeles County serves as a prime example of bloated police budgets, and great economic impact on communites of color due to killings at nearly double
            the rate than any other county in the United States. Men, on averge, make 20 to
            50 cents more than women on the dollar. Since men make up 96% of those killed by LA County police officers, the financial damage done to communiites of color is then likely even greater than the chart below indicates.</p>
